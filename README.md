# greet-locale

Install via npm: `npm i -S greet-locale`.

# Usage
Quickly hacked this package out, doesn't support many languages yet. Code is extremely simple (see `/index.js`). Feel free to make a PR.

```
var greetLocale = require('greet-locale')
console.log(greetLocale('ro')) // "Buna"
console.log(greetLocale('de')) // "Hallo"
```
